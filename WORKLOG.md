# 2020-02-12 The chemical lemonade stand

This is an interview assingment to create a quick page to help a fictious lab-tech log the concentration of lemonade. It is designed to test if I can find my way around using Typescript and React. The lab-tech can enter the values in a grid in which it will be logged and also it should appear on chart.

For the grid I am leaning toward just using a plain HTML table. As for the charts I think Charts.js is pretty straight forward and simple with the react wrapper.

On a side note, although codesandbox.io comes pretty close to a full fledged IDE it also ate this file a few times and will eat files called `CHANGELOG.md` for no clear reason.
